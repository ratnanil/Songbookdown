Bm                            D
I know I can't take one more step towards you
A                              Em
'Cause all thats waiting is regret
Bm                               D
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
A                              G
You lost the love I loved the most
Em                 D      A
I learned to live half a life
Em           D             Asus4  A
And now you want me one more time

Chorus
D                     A
Who do you think you are?
                        Bm
Running 'round leaving scars
                      G
Collecting a jar of hearts
 Gm            D
Tearing love apart
D                     A
You're gonna catch a cold
                          Bm
From the ice inside your soul
                     G
Don't come back for me
Gm                    D
Who do you think you are?
