\section{Wind of Change - Scorpions}

\begin{verbatim}
F  Dm  F  Dm*  Am*  G*  C!

C               Dm
I follow the Moskva
              C
Down to Gorky Park
                 Dm*      Am*  G* C!
Listening to the wind of change

C                Dm
An August summer night
                 C
Soldiers passing by
                 Dm*      Am*  G* C!
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers

The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change 
Chorus (2nd Part):
C    G         Dm           G
Take me to the magic of the moment
     C     G
On a glory night
          Dm            G             Am
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
 F               G
In the wind of change
Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever



I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
Chorus (1st Part):
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change
Bridge:
Am                        G
The wind of change blows straight
                  Am
Into the face of time
                           G
Like a stormwind that will ring
                              Am
The freedom bell for peace of mind
                   C
Let your balalaika sing
                        Em     E7
What my guitar wants to say
