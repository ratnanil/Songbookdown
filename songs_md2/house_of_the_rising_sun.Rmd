My mother was a tailor.\
She sewed my new blue jeans.\
My father was a gamblin' man\
Down in New Orleans.\

\
Now, the only thing a gambler needs\
Is a suitcase and a trunk\
And the only time that he's satisfied\
Is when he's on a drunk\
\
Oh, Mothers, tell your children\
Not to do what I have done.\
Spend your lives in sin and misery\
In the house of the risin' sun.\
\
Well, I've got one foot on the platform.\
the other foot on the train.\
I'm goin' down to New Orleans\
To wear that ball and chain.\
