{title: Marys Bornchild}

[G]             [C]   [Am]        [D]        [G]
Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible says,  
[G]             [C]   [Am]        [G]     [D]       [G]
Mary's boychild, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

[G]      [C]      [D]    [G]     [Em]     [Am]   [D]
Hark now! Hear the Angels sing, a King was born today, 
   [G]              [C]  [Am]   [G]      [D]       [G]
and man will live forever more because of Christmas Day.

[G]                        [C]       [Am]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night, 
          [D]                [G]
they see a bright new shining star. 
                 [C]    [Am]
They hear a choir sing a song,  
         [G]       [D]        [G]
the music seemed to come from afar.  
  
{chorus} 

[G]               [C]   [Am]          [D]            [G]
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night. 
[G]                   [C]      [Am]
They found no place to bear the child,  
     [G]    [D]         [G]
not a single room was in sight.

[G]     [C]       [D]    [G]    [Em]      [Am]      [D]
Trumpets sound and Angels sing...listen to what they say, 
[D] [G]              [C]  [Am]   [G]      [D]       [G]
that man will live forever more because of Christmas Day.

[G]                  [C]    [Am]       [D]           [G]
And then they found a little nook, in a stable all forlorn. 
[G]             [C]      [Am]         [G]    [D]     [G]
And in a manger, cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.
