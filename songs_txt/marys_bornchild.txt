Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible says,  
G                C     Am          G       D         G

While shepherds watch their flocks by night,

they see a bright new shining star. 
                  C      Am 
They hear a choir sing a song,

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night. 
G                      C        Am 
They found no place to bear the child,  
      G      D           G 
not a single room was in sight.

G        C         D      G      Em        Am        D 
Trumpets sound and Angels sing...listen to what they say, 
D    G                C    Am     G        D         G 
that man will live forever more because of Christmas Day.

G                C        Am           G      D       G 
And in a manger, cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.

G                C     Am          D          G 
Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible says,
