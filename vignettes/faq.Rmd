## How do I get started?

Assuming you have a fairly new version of `R` and an IDE installed (e.g. RStudio), install `bookdown` and `songbookdown`. To produce pdf ouputs, install `tinytex` and run the function `install_tinytex()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
devtools::install_github("ratnanil/songbookdown")

# to produce pdf outputs:
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```


## And then?

Next, create the files minimally needed for `bookdown` project. This consists of the following files:

- [x] `_bookdown.yaml`
- [x] `index.Rmd`
- [x] a folder where the (intermediate) Rmd files can be stored (e.g. `rmd`)
- [x] a folder where the book is compiled to (e.g. `docs`)

Additionally, `songbookdown` requires the following files:

- [x] `_songbookdown.yaml`
- [x] a folder where the raw song-files are stored. (e.g. `songs_raw`)

These files can be generated using the function `create_template()`


## How do I add a new song?

Add subfolders to `songs_raw`. These subfolders will create different chapters in your book, e.g. "Classics" and "Christmas Songs".

Create a plain text file (e.g. mysong.txt) in one of the subfolders of `songs_raw`. Add song meta data in a yaml-header similar to RMarkdown yaml headers in the following form (the yaml header must be wrapped with three or more dashes `---`):

```
---
title: Here Comes the Sun
artist: the Beatles
year: 1969
---

Here comes the sun
Doo doo doo doo
Here comes the sun and I say
It's alright
...
```

You can add *any* metadata in this form, and this data will be displayed in a tabular fashion at the end of the song. Some keywords have a special meaning: E.g. a `title` is required and used to build the songs's header. `title`, `artist`, `composer`, `lyricist` and `album` are used in the glossary. 
Mentioning the `source` is recommened. Here's a list of keywords that are used in the chord-pro syntax:

- `title:`
- `subtitle:`
- `artist:`
- `composer:`
- `lyricist:`
- `copyright:`
- `album:`
- `year:`
- `key:`
- `time:`
- `tempo:`
- `duration:`
- `capo:`
- `source:`

## What about the rest of the song? 

Add the rest of the song in plain text. It will be rendered into a monospaced font where lines are not broken. The reasoning behind this is that you can copy and paste plain text songs from sources like ultimate-guitar.com where monospacing helps keep chords and text aligned. 

You add further structure to the song in a [chordpro](https://www.chordpro.org) type manner. From the chord pro syntax, the following [environment directives](https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/directives-env/) are implemented<sup>1</sup>

- [x] `{start_of_chorus}`
- [x] `{end_of_chorus}`
- [ ] ~`{chorus}`~
- [x] `{start_of_verse}`
- [x] `{end_of_verse}`
- [x] `{start_of_bridge}`
- [x] `{end_of_bridge}`
- [x] `{start_of_tab}`
- [x] `{end_of_tab}`
- [x] `{start_of_grid}`
- [x] `{end_of_grid}`


As in the chordpro specification, all environment directives may include an optional label to identify the section. For example: `{start_of_verse: Verse 1}` The label should not include special characters and must be seperated from the `:` with a space.

<sup>1</sup>(only the "long forms" are implemented, not the short forms)


## How do I add a new chapter into the book?

Create a subfolder in the `songs_raw` folder. Add the name of the folder to `subfolders:` in `_songbookdown.yml` and add a title.

```
subfolders: 
  mynewfolder:
    title: The title of the new chapter (required) 
    description: |
      An optional description
      that can span over muliple lines
      (currently this description is not used anywhere,
      but will be implemented in the near future)
```



## How do I add chords to songs?

This feature is currently not active. 

~The project includes the library `tabr`, which generates beautiful chord diagrams from vectors with the `plot_chord` function. I've written a rapper around this function named `plot_chords` (note the `s`) which takes a named list `list(chordname = chordspec)` and draws a grid with ca. 4 columns (empty columns when less than 4 chords).~
